class ShakeData:
    """A class for retrieving, reading, converting and extracting
       data from shakefiles.

    Shake files are provided on an ftp server. There are two files for every
    event:
       * an 'inp' file
       * an 'out' file

    These files are provided on the ftp server as zip files. For example:
        * `ftp://118.97.83.243/20110413170148.inp.zip`_
        * `ftp://118.97.83.243/20110413170148.out.zip`_

    There are numerous files provided within these two zip files, but there
    are only really two that we are interested in:

        * grid.xyz - which contains all the metadata pertaining to the event
        * mi.grd - which contains the GMT formatted raster shake MMI data.

    This class provides a high level interface for retrieving this data and
    then extracting various by products from it.
